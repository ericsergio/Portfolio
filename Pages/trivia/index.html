			<!--<p>This project was an earlier project that I built when I first learned PHP. I am working on updating it to reflect 
				newer techniques, best practices, and standards that I have since learned (such as ECMAScript etc). That said,
				I am still pretty proud of this project as it uses JavaScript prototypes, SQL Procedures, PHP-SQL transactions, 
				PDO database communication, temporary dynamic database modelling, and a permanent database. I intend on continuing to update this 
				app to use JavaScript Promises and the overall code quality/standards so this should be considered a work in progress.
				In it's current state, press start and follow the prompts to start a game.
